# SailPoint Setup Helpers

This repository is a collection of scripts, notes, and resources designed to assist with setting up SailPoint integrations with various platforms. Many of these platforms may have limited or unclear documentation, so this repo aims to provide practical examples and guidance to streamline the integration process.
